Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based approach for detecting plant diseases using transfer learning and CNN models.

** Project Overview**
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to classify plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained using EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, with ResNet50 being used as the best model for prediction.

The trained model is deployed as a Streamlit web application, where users can upload images of leaves to detect possible plant diseases.

** Dataset Information**
Dataset: New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)
Classes: Multiple plant diseases + healthy leaves
